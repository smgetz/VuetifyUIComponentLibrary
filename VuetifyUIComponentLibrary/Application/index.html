    Application 
In Vuetify, the v-app component and the app prop on components like v-navigation-drawer, v-app-bar, v-footer help
bootstrap your application with the proper sizing around your <v-main> component.

The v-app component is REQUIRED for all applications.
This is the mount point for many of Vuetify's components functionality and ensures proper cross-browser support for certain
click events.

v-app should only be rendered within your application ONCE.

<!-- 
    Default Application Markup 
Example of the default markup for Vuetify. You can place your layout elements anywehre,
as long as you apply the app property. The key component to making your page content work together with layout elements is v-main.
The v-main component will be dynamically sized depending upon the structure of your designated app components.
